 <h1>ABOUT MY PET</h1>
 
 <P>The name of my pet is Bubba.She is a german shepherd,she is just 4 months and will be turning 5 months by the ending of august she is very big for 4months and i wonder how she will be when she is 5months or maybe she may just be the same .</P>
 <p>She loves playing with my small sister,i think it is because they are like almost the same height and she sees her as an equal and also maybe because nobody except her has the time to play with her.She can be a little annoying and it irritates me alot,cause imagine that you are busy with your phone and before you know it one big heavy thing has landed on you, it is kind of annoying,
she is the reason my phone spoilt self,and at that point i was already seeing RIP next to her name it was not funny actually.
 </p>
 <p>There are some attributes i love about her though, they are;</p>
 <ol>
    <li>she is a very fast runner</li>
    <li>she loves to cuddle,which i really need during this cold period</li>
    <li>she knows when you are angry,and doesnt come close</li>
    <li>she is a good catcher</li>
    <li>and the last is she knows her own</li>
 </ol>
 <p>I dont really know what to talk about again though,oh! yes before i forget her fur is a mixture of black and brown which makes her very pretty. i think she even has a crush on our neighbours dog Alex,he is a very big dog and i fear him alot,if not for my dog he would bitten me a long time ago .
 </p>
 <p>THE END</p>
